     * The topology does not count the number of propagators in the loop but the
     * number of particles connected to it. For only 3-vertices those two 
     * situations are equivalent but when higher order vertices are connected to
     * the loop they are not. For example, a 4-vertex looping with a 3-vertex by
     * 2 propagators is a Triangle because the loop is connected to three 
     * external particles (2 from the 4-vertex + 1 form the 3-vertex).
