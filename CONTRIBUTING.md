# Contributing Guidelines for `MARTY`


## Before each new Release

Make sure that all these steps are done before releasing a new version:

- Update the README.md for possible changes in build / dependencies
- Update the website accordingly (release news)
- Update the manual for new / modified features
- Update the version strings in file documentation
- Update the MARTY_VERSION_STR definition in `src/marty/core/marty.h`

The release in itself should be done on github, using a [tag](https://github.com/docbrown1955/marty-public/tags)
and defining the associated [release](https://github.com/docbrown1955/marty-public/releases).
